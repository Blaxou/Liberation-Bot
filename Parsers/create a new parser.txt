You can create your own parser by inserting your python name <college>.py

This file must contain :

  * One class named "Parser" of type object

    This class must have :

      - An attribute named "lesson_regexp" containing a Regular Expression that matches any of the lessons of your college

      - A function named "check" that when executed sets self.librs to an array of liberations which are dictionnaries :
      {'text':<The lesson text>,
      'groups':<The groups returned when matched with self.lesson_regexp>,
      'header':<The Title of the page (Leave a blank text if you won't use it)>}
